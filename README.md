# About

Dementia patients often face significant challenges in maintaining their daily routines and ensuring personal safety due to memory loss and cognitive decline. Caregivers, on the other hand, are tasked with the constant and demanding responsibility of monitoring the well-being of their loved ones, often with limited resources and tools. The need for a comprehensive, technology-driven solution is paramount to bridge this gap and provide real-time support to both patients and caregivers.

Our system enhances safety and care through comprehensive, real-time monitoring and personalized support for both patients and caregivers.
